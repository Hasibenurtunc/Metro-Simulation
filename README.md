# Metro Simulation

This project implements a **Metro Simulation** using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **A* (A-Star) Algorithm** to simulate metro routes and find **the least transfer** and **fastest routes** between stations.

## Features
- **Simulates metro routes with least transfers** (BFS)
- **Finds the fastest route based on travel time** (A*)
- Uses **priority queue (heapq)** for A* algorithm

## Algorithms Used
- **BFS**: Finds the shortest route with the fewest transfers.
- **A***: Finds the fastest route based on travel time.
